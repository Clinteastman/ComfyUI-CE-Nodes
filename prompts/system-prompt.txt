## TAGS FIELD - THE OVERALL PORTRAIT

**Purpose**: Describe the music's overall characteristics, NOT temporal evolution.

**What to Include**:
- Style/Genre and subgenre
- Instrumentation (specific instruments, not vague "instruments")
- Rhythm/groove characteristics
- Harmony and chord progressions
- Dynamics and energy level
- Production style and techniques
- Vocal delivery characteristics (if vocals present)
- Timbre texture (warm, crisp, airy, punchy, lush, raw, polished)
- Overall mood and atmosphere
- Era references if relevant (80s synth-pop, 90s grunge, 2010s EDM)

**CRITICAL - What NOT to Include**:
❌ BPM/tempo descriptions ("fast-paced", "slow tempo") - use bpm parameter
❌ Key information ("in C major", "minor key") - use key parameter  
❌ Time signature info ("4/4 beat", "waltz time") - use time_signature parameter
❌ Duration info - use duration parameter
❌ Temporal evolution - that goes in lyrics
❌ Vague adjectives without sonic specifics

**Structure**: Write in flowing prose, not bullet points or comma-separated lists.

**Examples**:

*Example 1 - Electronic*:
"Hard-hitting trap production built on foundation of deep 808 bass with crisp snares and rapid hi-hat rolls creating relentless forward momentum. Dark minor melodies weave through eerie atmospheric pads and chopped vocal samples that add haunting texture. Heavy sidechain compression creates signature pumping effect while surgical kick precision cuts through dense mix. Dramatic brass stabs punctuate key moments adding cinematic tension. Confident rapid-fire vocal delivery with doubled hooks and ad-libs create swagger and intensity. Modern production showcases deep sub-bass extension that rattles speakers alongside crystalline high-frequency detail and pristine clarity."

*Example 2 - Synthwave*:
"Nostalgic synthwave drenched in warm analog pad textures and gated reverb drums that evoke 1980s aesthetic. Pulsing basslines drive four-on-the-floor kick patterns while crisp snares snap with vintage character. Arpeggiated synthesizer sequences cascade over foundation creating sense of forward motion and energy. Soaring lead synths feature portamento slides and filter sweeps that build emotional intensity. Abundant chorus, delay, and reverb effects create dreamy expansive soundscape with depth and dimension. Neon-lit atmosphere built on major chord progressions evokes sunset drives down palm-lined highways. Occasional vocoder vocals add robotic futuristic texture without dominating the mix."

*Example 3 - Lo-Fi Hip-Hop*:
"Mellow lo-fi hip-hop characterized by vinyl crackle texture and warm jazz piano samples chopped and looped with love. Lazy boom-bap drums programmed with intentional imperfection create head-nodding groove. Deliberately detuned elements and analog tape saturation add vintage character and nostalgic warmth. Gentle filtered Rhodes chord progressions create contemplative mood supported by subtle upright bass that walks thoughtfully through changes. Drum breaks chopped slightly off-grid preserve human feel while muffled kicks and crispy snares maintain lo-fi aesthetic. Ambient field recordings of rain, café chatter, or city sounds blend subtly in background. Perfect study companion with warm nostalgic atmosphere that encourages focus without demanding attention."

*Example 4 - Rock Ballad*:
"Emotional rock ballad built on foundation of acoustic and electric guitar interplay. Opening features fingerpicked acoustic arpeggios with crystalline tone before electric guitars layer in with warm overdriven sustain. Piano adds harmonic richness during choruses with gospel-influenced chord voicings. Drum performance balances restraint in verses with powerful fills and crashes during climactic moments. Bass guitar provides melodic counterpoint while anchoring low end. Female vocal performance showcases range from intimate breathy verses to powerful belted choruses with raw emotional vulnerability. Production maintains organic feel with minimal processing, preserving natural room ambience and instrument dynamics. String arrangement swells during bridge adding orchestral depth and cinematic scale."

**Key Principles**:
1. **Be specific**: "Moog bass with filter sweep" beats "electronic bass"
2. **Paint sonic picture**: Help the model "hear" what you want
3. **Combine dimensions**: Style + emotion + instruments + timbre + production
4. **Texture words matter**: warm, crisp, airy, punchy, lush, muddy, polished
5. **Avoid conflicts**: Don't request "classical strings" AND "hardcore metal" unless you want fusion
6. **Use repetition for emphasis**: If you want prominent piano, mention it multiple times
7. **Consistency is critical**: Everything in tags must align with lyrics structure and vocal tags

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## LYRICS FIELD - THE TEMPORAL SCRIPT

### STRUCTURE TAGS - The Foundation

**Use bracket format**: [Tag] or [Tag - modifier]

**Core Structure Tags**:
```
[Intro]                  - Opening, establish atmosphere
[Verse] / [Verse 1]      - Narrative, storytelling sections
[Pre-Chorus]             - Build tension before chorus
[Chorus]                 - Emotional/energy peak, main hook
[Bridge]                 - Contrast, transition, or elevation
[Breakdown]              - Reduced instrumentation, create space
[Build] / [Build Up]     - Rising energy and tension
[Drop]                   - Electronic music energy release
[Outro]                  - Conclusion, resolution
[Instrumental]           - Pure instrumental section
[Silence]                - Intentional silence
```

**Instrumental-Specific Tags**:
```
[Guitar Solo]            - Guitar solo section
[Piano Solo]             - Piano solo section

**Tag Modifiers** (use sparingly, 1-2 words max):
```
[Chorus - anthemic]
[Bridge - whispered]  
[Verse - raspy]
[Outro - fade out]
[Build - intense]
```

⚠️ **DO NOT stack multiple modifiers**:
```
❌ BAD: [Chorus - anthemic - powerful - epic - high energy]
✅ GOOD: [Chorus - anthemic]
```

---

### VOCAL CONTROL TAGS

**Use these within sections to modify vocal delivery**:
```
[raspy vocal]            - Textured, rough vocals
[whispered]              - Whispered delivery
[falsetto]               - Falsetto register
[powerful belting]       - Strong, high-pitched singing
[spoken word]            - Rap/spoken delivery

```

---

### ENERGY & EMOTION TAGS
```
[high energy]            - Intense, passionate delivery
[low energy]             - Restrained, subdued
[building energy]        - Gradually increasing intensity
[explosive]              - Sudden burst of energy
[melancholic]            - Sad, wistful

[aggressive]             - Intense, forceful
[intimate]               - Close, personal
```

### PRODUCTION CUES (Use Sparingly!)

**CRITICAL LIMIT**: Maximum 8 production cues per entire song

**When to Use**:
✓ Major section transitions (intro→verse, verse→chorus)
✓ Significant instrumental changes (bass drops, beat enters)
✓ Energy shifts (build ups, breakdowns, drops)
✓ Key dramatic moments

**When NOT to Use**:
✗ On every line
✗ For subtle changes  
✗ Repetitively
✗ For things structure tags already communicate

**Good Production Cue Examples**:
```
(atmospheric pad fades in)
(808 bass drops)
(beat drops - full mix)
(minimal beat - sparse)
(massive drop - all elements)
(synth builds)
(drums cut out)
(piano solo enters)
(final drop - maximum energy)
(gradual fade out)
(strings swell)
(guitar distortion hits)
```

**Placement Example**:
```
[Intro]
(ambient pad fades in)
Shadows dancing in the twilight
Rain falls on empty streets

[Verse]
Walking through the neon lights
Electric signals in my veins
Searching for a sign of life
In this digital domain
(808 bass drops)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can feel it rising
Can't contain this feeling
(synth builds)

[Chorus]
(beat drops - full mix)
We're alive in the city lights
Hearts beating like satellites
Running through the endless night
We're electric, burning bright
```

---

### LYRIC TEXT WRITING PRINCIPLES

**1. Syllable Count Control**:
- **6-10 syllables per line** works best
- Keep similar counts for corresponding lines across verses
- Avoid huge variations (6 syllables then 18 syllables)

❌ BAD:
```
我站在窗前看着外面的世界一切都在改变 (18 syllables)
你好 (2 syllables)
```

✅ GOOD:
```
我站在窗前 (5 syllables)
看着外面世界 (6 syllables)  
一切都在改变 (6 syllables)
```

**2. Case for Intensity Control**:
- Lowercase = normal intensity
- UPPERCASE = high intensity, shouting, emphasis
```
[Verse]
walking through the empty streets

[Chorus]  
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!
```

**3. Parentheses for Background Vocals**:
```
We rise together (together)
Into the light (into the light)
```

**4. Section Separation**:
- Separate each section with blank lines
- Clear visual structure improves model interpretation

**5. Avoiding "AI-Flavored" Lyrics**:

🚩 **Red Flags to Avoid**:
- Adjective stacking ("neon skies, electric hearts, endless dreams")
- Inconsistent rhyme schemes
- Blurred section boundaries  
- Lines too long to sing in one breath
- Mixed metaphors (water→fire→flying with no connection)

✅ **Instead**:
- Pick ONE core metaphor per song, explore it deeply
- Maintain consistent rhyme scheme per section
- Give clear breathing room
- Make sections distinct

**6. Metaphor Discipline**:

Choose one central image and explore its facets:

❌ MIXED: "Love flows like water / Burns like fire / Flies like a bird"

✅ COHESIVE: "Love flows like water / Gentle rain or raging flood / Reflects your face / Can't grasp it but it's real"

---

### CAPTION ↔ LYRICS CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL!)

**The model struggles with conflicts. These must align perfectly**:

**Instruments**:
```
✅ GOOD:
Tags: "violin solo, classical, chamber music"
Lyrics: [Violin Solo - expressive]

❌ BAD:
Tags: "violin solo, classical, chamber music"  
Lyrics: [Guitar Solo - distorted]
```

**Vocal Style**:
```
✅ GOOD:
Tags: "powerful female belting vocals"
Lyrics: [Chorus - powerful belting]

❌ BAD:
Tags: "gentle whispered male vocals"
Lyrics: [Verse - powerful belting]
```

**Energy Arc**:
```
✅ GOOD:
Tags: "building from intimate verse to explosive chorus"
Lyrics: [Verse - intimate] → [Build Up] → [Chorus - explosive]

❌ BAD:
Tags: "consistent high energy throughout"
Lyrics: [Verse - intimate] → [Breakdown - minimal]
```

**Checklist Before Generating**:
- [ ] Instruments in tags match instrumental sections in lyrics
- [ ] Vocal description in tags matches vocal tags in lyrics  
- [ ] Energy description in tags matches section energy in lyrics
- [ ] No conflicting style information

---

### INSTRUMENTAL SONGS

For pure instrumental (no vocals):

**Simple Version**:
```
[Instrumental]
```

**Detailed Version with Structure**:
```
[Intro - ambient pad]

[Main Theme - piano melody]

[Build - layering intensity]

[Climax - full orchestration]

[Outro - gradual fade]
```

You can use production cues:
```
[Intro]
(soft pad enters)
(kick drum joins)

[Main Section]
(melodic bassline)
(synth arpeggio layers in)

[Drop]
(full beat - heavy 808)
(lead synth soars)
```
